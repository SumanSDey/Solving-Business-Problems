* 44.77% Twitter users tweeted positive content on the social media platform, which is the highest proportion when tweets were classified on the basis of proportion of positive, negative & neutral tweets.
Analysing the polar plot:
* The highest activity was observed at round figure numbers like 10:30 am, 2pm, 3pm etc. Again at night after 2am peaking at 4am & continuing till 10 am.
* There has been a strange fall in tweets in te period from 10am-10:30am morning & 8 pm-12am night.

The above two points indicate towards a few possibilities:
a) The tweets are both original opinion oriented & bot generated to mould sentiments
b) People & bots in foreign countries with time difference of above 7 hours or more are also participating in tweeting activity

If tweets are original opinion of some authentic user, then its resident Indians tweeting in the interval 10:30am to 8pm & tweets after 2am indicate possibility of activity by NRIs & other players interested
in Indian politics.
The peaking of tweet numbers at round figure timestamps indicate possible deployment of bots. Also IT cell people as they might have figured out some relation of timing & effectiveness of tweets 
The strange fall in the morning for such a small duration can be due to many reasons, but in the evening depicts involvement in social activities of users, be it going out, having dinner, watching prime time
shows etc.
