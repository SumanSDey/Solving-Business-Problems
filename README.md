When I am doing this project, India is going into 2024 Lok Sabha (Lower House/ House of Commons) elections.
### ****Use of Generative AI:**** 

#### I have used Prompt Engineering for code generation in the entire project. I've used chatGPT 3.5 & Google Gemini. Even error handling has been done using these two LLMs

Now. let's begin!

#### ****Carnegie Endowment for International Peace**** says in an article "The United States feels roiled by polarization, and the philanthropic world is seized with debates about what to do. Some scholars claim that Americans are so polarized they are on the brink of civil war". On the other side of the world, in India, we witness very heated debates taking place in media to tea stalls & social gatherings. All this is a result of the polarization of the masses.
#### The problem of polariization & fake news takes a serious turn when the elections approach.
#### The biggest contributor to this polarization is Fake News creating controversies. The social media, especially X(earlier Twitter), has established itself as the most prominent medium for spreading Fake News, followed by WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook etc.

#### In earlier times, news used to be delivered by professional journalists & media houses after proper verifiction of the sourses. This has acted as the first & most important line of defence against fake news & propaganda. But with the advent of social media, this verification mechanism has literally vanished! Any news reaches the mass audience in a blink of an eye.

#### In order to filter fake news & propaganda, X & other social media companies have deployed very efficient AI-ML models. ****Sentiment Analysis**** is one of the very important tasks performed by these models to draw insights by:

 * #### Categorising tweets as positive, negative & neutral. This in turn, alerts the models for further actions they need to take. Such measures prevent foul players from misguiding the masses & in time of elections prevent from acting as an indirect mode of rigging!

 * #### pin-pointing other factors like tiem time when tweets/re-tweets upsurge, what are the most used words & hashtags etc.
