Netflix Recommender System:

This Notebook presents a recommendation system for movies and TV shows using two different methods:
Boolean (Bag of Words, BoW) and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
The system uses text descriptions of movies and TV shows to provide recommendations based on similarity scores.

This recommendation system demonstrates the effectiveness of TF-IDF in providing accurate and relevant recommendations for movies and TV shows. It also showcases the computational efficiency of cosine similarity in comparison to Jaccard similarity.
