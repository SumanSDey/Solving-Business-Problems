# Solving_business_problems
This repository contains projects (I like to term them as Business problems as that is actually what they are!) that I have worked/working on. 
My main focus is on finding solutions using the power of Generative AI tools, be it using LLMs like chatGPT, Google Gemini etc for neat & 
error-free code generation to using Mostly.ai, chatCSV and other tools to achieve not just efficiency & accuracy but also to boost productivity
in every step of the data sciene methodology be it synthetic data generation, drawing statistical insights, multiple visualization plots with just
one click or be it selecting the best ML model that delivers the best predictions using Generative AI.

All this is just an endeavour to develop in future a DS-ML DevOps cycle so that I be able to build mechanisms that act seamlessly to deliver real-time
solutions for almost every problem at hand!
